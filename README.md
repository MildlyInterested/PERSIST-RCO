The primary intention of PERSIST is for use as a story-making device to allow mission makers easily create long-running campaigns. In my case I combine this with the NR6 HAL mod to face a changing battle against an AI commander, but it could also be used for just about any type of operation - the first that come to mind are insurgent, COIN, humanitarian or post-apocalyptic operations.
